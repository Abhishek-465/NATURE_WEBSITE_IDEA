                <h1>The Beauty of Nature</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Nature has given us so much that we cannot even imagine. Life on this earth is possible only because of nature. There are many other planets in the universe but without this nature life is not possible there. Thus nature is the basis of our life. Nature is not the same everywhere on earth. According to the place, nature changes its appearance and according to that place provides us with resources, as well as provides comfort to our mind, our eyes.

                    Nature gives us so much, so it is our duty to respect it knowing its importance and not to destroy it for our selfishness. So that the children of man can also enjoy its beauty and take advantage of it, otherwise one day will be when people will be able to see and feel the beauty of this nature on the computer itself.

                <h1>By Michael Popejoy, Fellow in the Department of Philosophy,HARVARD UNIVERSITY</h1>
                <hr>
                <p> “I declare this world is so beautiful that I can hardly believe it exists.”  The beauty of nature can have a profound effect upon our senses, those gateways from the outer world to the inner, whether it results in disbelief in its very existence as Emerson notes, or feelings such as awe, wonder, or amazement.  But what is it about nature and the entities that make it up that cause us, oftentimes unwillingly, to feel or declare that they are beautiful?

                    One answer that Emerson offers is that “the simple perception of natural forms is a delight.”  When we think of beauty in nature, we might most immediately think of things that dazzle the senses – the prominence of a mountain, the expanse of the sea, the unfolding of the life of a flower.  Often it is merely the perception of these things itself which gives us pleasure, and this emotional or affective response on our part seems to be crucial to our experience of beauty.  So in a way there is a correlate here to the intrinsic value of nature; Emerson says:
                    
                        the sky, the mountain, the tree, the animal, give us a delight in and for themselves
                    
                    Most often, it seems to me, we find these things to be beautiful not because of something else they might bring us – a piece of furniture, say, or a ‘delicacy’ to be consumed – but because of the way that the forms of these things immediately strike us upon observation. In fact, one might even think that this experience of beauty is one of the bases for valuing nature – nature is valuable because it is beautiful.
                    
                    Emerson seems to think that beauty in the natural world is not limited to certain parts of nature to the exclusion of others. He writes that every landscape lies under “the necessity of being beautiful”, and that “beauty breaks in everywhere.”  As we slowly creep out of a long winter in the Northeast, I think Emerson would find the lamentations about what we have ‘endured’ to be misguided:
                    
                        The inhabitants of the cities suppose that the country landscape is pleasant only half the year….To the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the same field it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before, and which shall never be seen again.
                    
                    The close observer of nature sees a river in constant flux, even when the river’s water is frozen and everything appears to be static and unchanging for a time. Nature can reveal its beauty in all places and at all times to the eye that knows how to look for it. We can hear Emerson wrangle with himself on this very point in the words of this journal entry:
                    
                        At night I went out into the dark and saw a glimmering star and heard a frog, and Nature seemed to say, Well do not these suffice?  Here is a new scene, a new experience.  Ponder it, Emerson, and not like the foolish world, hanker after thunders and multitudes and vast landscapes, the sea or Niagara.
